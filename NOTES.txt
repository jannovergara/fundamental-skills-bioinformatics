WEEK 1

Programming - instruct computer to perform tasks
Why? Because computers are fast and cheap and run 24hrs.
Follows a pre-defined logic and syntax, highly detailed and precise

R
- designed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
- designed for statistical analysis
- running as without a compiler
- open-source; GNU Public License
- written in C and Fortran
- CRAN stores code for R
- packages

RStudio
- integrated development environment
- not necessarily to work with R

Installing R: cran.rstudio.com

FSB: data types.
Instruction 1+2
Outcome 3

Instruction a <- 1+2

Classes
Numeric
- Integer (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Floating point (42.1)
- Complex (real and imaginary part, e.g. 3+1i)

Text
- Character ('a', 'B', ...)
- String

Instruction a <- "b"
Outcome new variable a
Instruction b <- "Valencia"
Outcome new variable b

Logical
- Boolean (True / False)

Special values
- Null: object returned when the result of a function is undefined
- NA: not available (missing value in dataset)
- NaN: not a number (eg. undefined mathematical operation)
- Inf: infinity (eg. number too large)

Scalar - single value of certain type
a = 2
a <- 2

Atomic Vector
- ordered set of values of same type; same type
- concatenation of atomic values
vec = c(1,2,3) 
v.n <- vector('numeric', length=3)

List - list of valies of variable type
lst = list('a', 'b')

Matrix - matrix of values same type
"name" = matrix("values", # of rows, # of columns)
?matrix

DataFrames - collection of columns
?data.frame
"name" = data.frame("define column 1", ..., "define column n")

Factor - list of fixed categorical values (levels)
f = factor(x = c(1,2,1))

Remember:
use function "class" to test for variable type

R is a column oriented programming language

FSB: control flow. If statement
FSB: control flow. Loop
FSB: Loading / Writing data.

Jupyter Notebooks

Data Quality control
Its hard to believe, but not all datasets are perfect!
- Missing measurements
- Invalid data type conversion
- Preprocessing produces invalid values

R features reserved words representing different cases:
- NA        "Not available" ...Missing value
- NaN       "Not a number"  ...Invalid computation
- (-)Inf    Infinite value  ...Mostly invalid computation
- Null      Empty object

is.na() / is.nan() / is.finite / is.null

Missing values
Values that are not feasible
Outliers

Explorative Data Analysis (EDA)
- statistical analysis
- hypothesis

Visualization
William Playfair
- Scottish engineer and a political economist
- founder of graphical methods of statistics
- line, area, pie, bar charts
- time series chart of England explaining the trade balance of England over time

Charles Joseph Minard
- information graphics
- summarizes Paris pavement maintenance over two centuries

Florence Nightingale
- social reformer
- founder of modern nursing
- polar area diagram
- seasonal sources of patient mortality

John Tukey
- mathematician and statistician
- boxplot
- 1977 book

PCA
Clustering
Correlation Analysis

t-Test and ANOVA
William Silly - student t-test

t-test assumptions
1. Both populations should follow a normal distribution
2. Same variance in both populations - Levene test
3. Independence

Examples for not independent
- follow up samples from same patients over time

ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance):
R Fisher
Null hypothesis:    "all means are the same"
- A general statement that states that there is no relationship between two measure phenomena or no association among groups
Alternative:        "means are not equal"
- Contrary to the NULL hypothesis, it state whenever something is happening, a new theory is preferred instead of an old one

P Value
- The P value is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis of a study question is true

Alpha Value
- The alpha value is a criterion for determining whether a test statistic is statistically significant

F Statistics
- An F Statistic is a value you get when you run an ANOVA test to find out if the means between two population are sinificantly different

Tukeys HSD (Honest significant difference) test

Consider the simplest case:
- three groups
- differences between them,
- within every population all equal

There is always random variation in a population
