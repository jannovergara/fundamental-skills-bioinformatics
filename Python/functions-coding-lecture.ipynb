    "#### Defining and using functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning that you can use it by simply stacking a series of instructions (*imperative/procedural paradigm*), or you can subdivide your code in a set of functions (*functional paradigm*), or you can structure the logic of your program through objects interacting with each other (*object-oriented paradigm*). Here we will discuss how to define and use functions in R. Objected-oriented programming, while generally useful, is outside the scope of this short course.\n",
    "\n",
    "On an intuitive level, functions are useful since they allow to group a parametrize sets of instructions that are often used togheter. In this way you avoid writing, and most importantly, maintaining several copies of the same code.\n",

Also, your function can have as many arguments as you need, whose names you can freely choose.\n",
