Python native data structures
- The two languages are interpreted - no need to compile before executing the code
- Dynamic typing - no need to declare in advance the type (eg. int, boolean, etc) of a variable

Relevant differences
- built-in data types are different
-- vectors and arrays are readily available in Relevant
-- tuples and dictionaries are present in Python

Loops, if statement, function declarations: different syntax

Lists: [3. True, "abc", 3] - ordered collection of values

Tuples: (3, True, "abc", 3) - similar to lists but once created cannot be modified

Sets: {3, True, "abc"} - collection of unique elements

Dictionaries: {"Key1":3, "OneMoreKey":True, "Key3":"abc"} - collection of unique keys each associated with a value
